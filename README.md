# PhysicsProject

Hey, this is my first publicly shown java project. With java SE 17, I created a functioning mockup of a physics engine. It doesn't simulate collision-- it only simulates gravitational forces between masses. 

In the current push with ID bf29801, there are two packages: the display package and the main package. They are responsible for displaying objects and calculating the physics updates, respectively. If I spent more time on this part of my final project, I would have documented all of my code and cleaned it a bit; since it is pretty messy and poorly optimized. However, due to the fact that it gets the point across that I understand how to use the formulas effectively, I feel like I do not need to demonstrate further what I know. 

Feel free to fork or clone this project if you want to improve on it. Thanks üëç
